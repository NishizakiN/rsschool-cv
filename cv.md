## About Me:
I'm currently working on getting certifications in the IT field. I've always been interested in it, but never could quite pinpoint the time to start.
I have almost a decade of experience teaching English as second language in China, Russia, and South Korea, and, having watched so many children fulfill their goals and go after their chosen dream, I realized the time is now.
I consider myself rather adept at problem solving and good with interpersonal communication, which, I hope, might come in handy when looking for a tech support position.
